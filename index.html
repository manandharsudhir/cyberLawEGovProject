                            Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a 
                            network. The criminal activity includes committing fraud, trafficking in child pornography and 
                            intellectual property, stealing identities, or violating privacy. It is one of the emerging crime 
                            around the world.

                            stop the attack. One form of cyberextortion is the ransomware attack. Here, the attacker 
                            gains access to an organization's systems and encrypts its documents and files -- anything
                            of potential value -- making the data inaccessible until a ransom is paid.

                            DoS attack deprives legitimate users (i.e. employees, members, or account holders) of the

                        In order to protect ourselves from the perils of cybercrime, the following preventative actions can be taken:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It is required to install an antivirus program. An antivirus program is designed to safeguard users against cybercrime. Modern programs monitor the machine’s data for harmful content and give real-time security against dangers like phishing.</li>
                            <li>Making use of a Virtual Private Network. A VPN connection will protect your online privacy.   It’s an important tool for privacy, which protects people from identity theft.</li>
                            <li>Unsolicited emails, text messages, and phone calls should be avoided, especially if they utilize the crisis to coerce people into circumventing standard security safeguards.</li>
                            <li>Change the Wi-Fi network’s default password to something more secure. Limit the number of devices that may connect to the Wi-Fi network and only allow trustworthy devices to connect.</li>
                            <li>Use lengthy and complicated passwords that incorporate numbers, letters, and special characters</li>
                            <li>Make sure to update all the systems and programs, as well as to install and maintain an antivirus software up to date.</li>
                            <li>Data backup should be a routine procedure since data may be quickly destroyed, infected, or manipulated.</li>
                        </ol>

                        To effectively combat cybercrime, multidimensional public-private alliances involving authorities, the digital tech industry, information security groups, internet firms, and financial institutions are required. Cyber thieves, unlike their counterparts in the physical world, do not compete for dominance or control. Instead, they collaborate to enhance their talents and even assist one another with new chances. As a result, traditional crime-fighting strategies cannot be employed to combat cybercrime in India. Mentioned below are some steps to prevent cybercrime:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Use complex passwords: </b>Use various login details combinations for separate accounts and avoid writing them down.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Keeping online profiles secret: </b>Make sure to keep your social networking profiles (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and so on) private. Make sure to double-check your security settings. Take caution with the information you put on the internet. Once it’s on the Internet, it’s there for good.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Safeguard mobile devices: </b>Many individuals are unaware that their mobile devices are exposed to dangerous software such as computer viruses. An individual should only download software from reputable sites. It is also critical that your operating system is kept up to date. Install anti-virus software and utilize a secure lock screen in addition. Otherwise, if you misplace your phone or lay it down for a few seconds, anyone may see all of your personal information on it. Someone may even install malicious software that uses GPS to follow your every step.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Safeguarding data: </b>Encrypt sensitive files such as financial documents and tax returns, to protect your data. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Secure online identity: </b>When it comes to protecting one’s identity online, an individual should be vigilant. When providing personal information such as your name, address, phone number, and/or financial information on the Internet, you must exercise extreme caution. While making an online purchase, etc., be sure to check whether the websites are safe. This includes turning on your privacy settings while using or visiting social networking sites.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Safeguarding computers with security software: </b>For basic internet security, several types of security softwares are required. Firewall and antivirus software are key pieces of security software. A firewall is typically the first line of defence for your computer. It governs who can communicate, and access the computer via the internet. Assume a firewall to be a type of ‘policeman’ who monitors all data attempting to flow to and from the computer via the Internet, permitting transactions that it knows are secure while preventing ‘bad’ traffic such as cyberattacks.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
