                        Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a 
                        network. The criminal activity includes committing fraud, trafficking in child pornography and 
                        intellectual property, stealing identities, or violating privacy. It is one of the emerging crime 
                        around the world.

                        While most of the cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the 
                        cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to 
                        damage or disable them. Others use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal 
                        information, images or other materials.

                    <p class="section-content">Cybercrime attacks can begin whenever there is digital data, opportunity and motive. There 
                        are various types of cybercrime. Some of them are as follows:</p>
                    <p class="section-subtitle">
                        Cyberextortion:
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-content">
                        A crime involving an attack or threat of an attack coupled with a demand for money to 
                        stop the attack. One form of cyberextortion is the ransomware attack. Here, the attacker 
                        gains access to an organization's systems and encrypts its documents and files -- anything
                        of potential value -- making the data inaccessible until a ransom is paid.
                    </p>

                        Identity Theft:

                    <p class="section-content">
                        An attack that occurs when an individual accesses a computer to glean a user's personal 
information, which they then use to steal that person's identity or access their valuable 
accounts, such as banking and credit cards. Cybercriminals buy and sell identity 
information on darknet markets, offering financial accounts, as well as other types of 
accounts, like video streaming services, webmail, video and audio streaming, online 
auctions and more.
                    </p>

                        Credit card fraud:
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-content">
                        An attack that occurs when hackers infiltrate retailers' systems to get the credit card 
and/or banking information of their customers. Stolen payment cards can be bought and 
sold in bulk on darknet markets, where hacking groups that have stolen mass quantities of
credit cards profit by selling to lower-level cybercriminals who profit through credit card 
fraud against individual accounts.

                    <p class="section-content">
                        Cyber espionage is a form of cyber attack that steals classified, sensitive data or 
                        intellectual property to gain an advantage over a competitive company or government 
                        entity.

                        An attack that involves the unlawful copying, distribution and use of software programs 
with the intention of commercial or personal use. Trademark violations, copyright 
infringements and patent violations are often associated with this type of cybercrime.

                        A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, 
                        making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the 
                        target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash. In both instances, the 
                        DoS attack deprives legitimate users (i.e. employees, members, or account holders) of the
                        service or resource they expected.
